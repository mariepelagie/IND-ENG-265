The aim of the project will be to assess whether using Cianiao’s Network logistics services is correlated with higher customer review scores and if with the available data, we can qualify the merchant’s decision to use Cainiao’s services over other default services. We will be focusing particularly on the three types of customer ratings provided which includes ratings for on time delivery, service quality and order quality.
